l = [2,3,7,1,4,8]

l.sort()                #gives the same list but changes order [1,2,3,4,7,8]

l.sort(reverse = True)  #gives [8,7,4,3,2,1]

sorted(l)               #gives a new copy of the list that is sorted

Bubble sort:

7,2,8,9,1,6 

looks at twos and sees if they are sorted or not. 
looks at 7,2 and sorted them so 2,7

2,7,8,9,1,6

looks through up to 9,1 and sorts them so its 1,9 
etc.. 
then does the whole process again until all are sorted.
